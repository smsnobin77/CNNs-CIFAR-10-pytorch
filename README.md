# CNNs-CIFAR-10-pytorch
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implementation using Pytorch on the CIFAR 10 dataset

## Assignment Description
Used Pytorch (not Tensorflow) to implement the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR 10 dataset (60,000 small square 3x32Ã—32 pixel color images ( 3 input channels for color image)).

## Model Architecture of CNN
* Used ResNet-18

## Experimental results  
* Test accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score calculated
* Training loss and accuracy plotted as figure
